## ðŸ“˜ Problem List

### ðŸ”¹ Array

#### ðŸŸ¢ Problem 01: [Moving Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
**Description:**  
Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.  
**Note:** You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.

#### ðŸŸ¢ Problem 02: [Majority Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
**Description:**  
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. <br>
The majority element is the element that appears more than `âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array. <br>
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space? <br>
`This problem is solved by Boyer-Moore voting algorithm`

#### ðŸŸ¢ Problem 03: [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
**Description:**  
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in `nums`.

#### ðŸŸ¢ Problem 04: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)
**Description:**  
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
You want to maximize your `profit` by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.<br>

Return the maximum `profit` you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any `profit`, return `0`.

#### ðŸŸ¢ Problem 05: [Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/)
**Description:**  
Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

### ðŸ”¹ Two Pointer

#### ðŸŸ¢ Problem 01: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
**Description:**  
Given a `1-indexed` array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers `[index1]` and numbers `[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, added by one as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length `2`.
